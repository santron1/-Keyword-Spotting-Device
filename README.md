## Edge Impulse Custom Inference Code for ESP32 DevKit

### Introduction
This project utilizes the Edge Impulse platform for machine learning inference, customized to work with the ESP32 DevKit microcontroller. While Edge Impulse primarily supports powerful microprocessors like ESP32-CAM and Arduino Nano 33 BLE, I successfully adapted the code to function with the ESP32 DevKit. This adaptation process involved significant modifications to the Edge Impulse library, spanning a period of 2.5 months.

### Features
- Utilizes the Edge Impulse platform for machine learning inference.
- Customized code to enable compatibility with the ESP32 DevKit.
- Achieved an accuracy of 90% through meticulous optimization and fine-tuning.
- Offers seamless integration with Edge Impulse's machine learning models for real-time inference on the ESP32 DevKit.

### Development Journey
- **Initial Challenges:** The project began with challenges in adapting Edge Impulse's existing codebase to support the ESP32 DevKit. Limited resources and documentation posed initial hurdles.
- **Continuous Learning:** Over the course of 2.5 months, I engaged in continuous learning and experimentation to understand and modify the Edge Impulse library effectively.
- **Optimization and Fine-tuning:** Through iterative optimization and fine-tuning, I improved the performance and accuracy of the machine learning models, achieving a commendable accuracy rate of 90%.
- **Collaborative Efforts:** While I sought assistance from resources like ChatGPT for guidance and problem-solving, the bulk of the development effort was driven by my individual commitment and perseverance.

### Conclusion
The custom Edge Impulse inference code for the ESP32 DevKit represents a significant achievement in machine learning integration with constrained microcontrollers. Despite the absence of readily available resources or precedent, I successfully adapted the code, demonstrating innovation, resilience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of embedded machine learning applications.

### Note
While the modified code has not been shared publicly, its development underscores my capability to overcome challenges, innovate, and create impactful solutions in the field of embedded systems and machine learning.
